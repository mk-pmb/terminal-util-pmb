Pluggable bashrc sourcer
========================

Easy quickstart: `./install_default_configs.sh`

Or you can also manually configure:

* Copy the dot files from [`home.rcfiles/`](home.rcfiles/)
  into your home directory.
  * You may want to backup your old ones first.
* Create directory `~/.config/bash`.
* Inside it, create a directory whose name ends in `.rcd`.
* Inside that, create your config file parts as `[rp]*_*.sh`.
